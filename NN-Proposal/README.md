# Proposed Model Development

The development of the proposed model is currently underway in **Google Colaboratory**, utilizing the **PyTorch Lightning** framework, thus employing the **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP) paradigm.

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Paradigm
The advantages mentioned in the previous section regarding object-oriented programming apply to this model as well. Furthermore, it enables its future use and manipulation in a thesis or other work, as it only requires calling the classes and methods to utilize it. Additionally, if necessary, this same model can be modified to fit specific needs.

## Implementation Structure
The implementation of the proposed model is divided into 3 scripts:
- **Data Loader**: Responsible for loading and preprocessing the dataset.
- **Proposed Network Model**: Contains the implementation of the proposed architecture.
- **Main Implementation**: The main script where the training and evaluation procedures are conducted.

## Proposed Network Architecture
The proposed network architecture is still under development, and there may be changes in the future. 

## Usage
To utilize the proposed model:
1. Set up the necessary environment with PyTorch and PyTorch Lightning installed.
2. Import the required scripts/modules.
3. Initialize the Data Loader and Proposed Model.
4. Execute the Main script to start the training and evaluation processes.
