# Development of a Deep Neural Convolutional Architecture for Classifying Diabetic Retinopathy Fundus Images

## Abstract 
Diabetic retinopathy is a complication of diabetes that affects the eyes, specifically the retina, and can lead to blindness, making early detection crucial. Based on this premise, the present thesis proposes a deep convolutional artificial neural network architecture for the classification of fundus photographs, identifying the presence or absence of diabetic retinopathy. This proposed network will be compared with a ResNet50 network to evaluate its performance, as the proposed network is intended to be computationally cost-effective and deployable on a laptop with internet connection.
Lastly, the integration of the developed architecture into a graphical interface will be explored.

## Status
For now, only the digital image preprocessing (preprocessing) and the ResNet model implemented in PyTorch Lightning are available in this repository.

**Note:** This project is currently a work in progress.
